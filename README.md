# password-generator-v1

Link to Repo: https://rginsberg549.github.io/password-generator-v1/

This project lets a site visitor generate a random password. It allows the user to specificy the following criteria:

1. Number of Characters between 8-12
2. Should the password contain:
    a. Lowercase
    b. Uppercase
    c. Special Characters
    d. Numbers

The site visitor can select none or ALL.

If the site visitor does not select any criteria, the default is ALL options.

A random password is generated based on the user selected password criteria.

Some nice additions I hope to add are ...
1. copy password to clipboard
2. more robust validation
3. transform this into a hash generator
4. improve the design to make it stand out
